Description: lightweight messaging kernel (shared library)
 ØMQ is a library which extends the standard socket interfaces with features
 traditionally provided by specialised messaging middleware products.
 .
 ØMQ sockets provide an abstraction of asynchronous message queues, multiple
 messaging patterns, message filtering (subscriptions), seamless access to
 multiple transport protocols and more.
 .
 This package contains the libzmq shared library.

Description: Transitional package for migration to libzmq3
  At the time the Dovetail Automata repo shipped packages for the
  upstream zeromq v. 4 release, Debian Sid was shipping v. 3.x in the
  'zeromq3' package.  Anticipating that Debian would ship a new
  zeromq4 package for the upstream zeromq v. 4 release, the Dovetail
  Automata repo did that.  However, Debian did not change the package
  name, instead shipping a 'zeromq3' v. 4 package.  This package
  follows https://wiki.debian.org/PackageTransition for renaming the
  'zeromq4' package to 'zeromq3'.  It can be removed after some time
  when users have updated to the newly-named package.
